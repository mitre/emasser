# emasser

## About

`emasser` is a command line interface (CLI) that aims to automate routine business use-cases and provide utility surrounding the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) by leveraging its representational state transfer (REST) application programming interface (API) v3.2.

## Documentation
emasser provides users with the following documentation:

[**eMASS API Documentation**](https://mitre.github.io/emasser/docs/redoc/) | [**eMASS Swagger UI**](https://mitre.github.io/emasser/docs/swagger/)

## Current Features

The following eMASS API HTTP methods are implemented:
* `GET` view eMASS resources
* `POST` add eMASS resources
* `PUT` update eMASS resources
* `DELETE` remove eMASS resources


[**emasser CLI Features**](docs/features.md) | [**emasser Developers Instructions**](docs/developers.md)

## In Development

This project is actively looking for user stories, features to build, and interactions with eMASS. See Roadmap for more information.

* Support raw JSON upload

## Roadmap

Emasser is currently in MVP development and we are targeting all the features listed in Current and In Development for version 1.0. The Road Map are things that the team and community have talked about as possible great additions but feedback on which should come first, second, and third are what we would love feedback on from you.

* Update a system's record with met/not met NIST 800-53 Security and Privacy controls and/or common control indicators (CCI) based on scan results expressed in [Heimdall Data Format (HDF)](https://saf.mitre.org/#/normalize).
* Resolve a particular plan of action and milestone (POA&M) based on scan results or git-ops workflow.
* PKCS11 support to run in an attended mode.

## Installation

`emasser` is a Ruby CLI that is distributed via git only. You must request the source from saf@groups.mitre.org

Installation Dependencies:
  * git
  * Ruby version 2.7 or greater.

Runtime Dependencies:
  * Ruby version 2.7 or greater.
  * `rubyzip (latest version)`
  * `swagger_client (latest version)` (Also referred to as `emass_client` and distributed via git only)

To install:
```bash
git clone <path to emasser git> emasser
cd emasser
gem build *.gemspec
gem install *.gem
```

## Use

**Requirement 1 & 2: Authentication and Authorization:**
`emasser` requires authentication to eMASS as well as authorization to use the eMASS API. This authentication and authorization is **not** a function of `emasser` and needs to be handled directly with discussions with eMASS. `emasser` will accept credentials that are created based on those discussions.

**Approve API Client for Actionable Requests**
Users are required to log-in to eMASS and grant permissions for a client to update data within eMASS on their behalf. This is only required for actionable requests (PUT, POST, DELETE). The Registration Endpoint and all GET requests can be accessed without completing this process with the correct permissions.

To establish an account with eMASS and/or acquire an api-key/user-uid, contact one of the listed POC:

* [eMASS New User Registration (CAC required)](https://nisp.emass.apps.mil/Content/Help/jobaids/eMASS_OT_NewUser_Job_Aid.pdf)


## Design

**Interactions with eMASS API:**
`emasser` leverages a MITRE dependency, `emass_client`, which provides a REST API client based on a MITRE-created [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) version 3 specification based on the official eMASS version 2.3 API documentation. This design enables REST API clients to be generated in [any supported programming language](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). This design decision enables `emass_client` to generate a Ruby client for `emasser` and a TypeScript client that is included with [Heimdall Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2).

**Business Logic:**
Because interactions with the API are handled by a dependency, the bulk of `emasser` is business logic for accepting user input/output, reading data from eMASS or from input, transforming data, and routing data to the appropriate eMASS API endpoint. This business logic is organized into Ruby Classes and Modules based on the command or subcommand requested by the user.
