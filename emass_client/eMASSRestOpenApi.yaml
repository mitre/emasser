  title: Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS)
  description: |
      The Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS) REST Application
      Programming Interface (API) enables users to perform assessments and complete actions
      associated with system records. This document will provide an outline of all eMASS
      objects and their associated endpoints to include Department of Defense (DoD) business
      rules that pertain to each.

      New users will need to register an API key with the eMASS development team prior to
      accessing the site for the first time. The eMASS REST API requires a client certificate
      (SSL/TLS, DoD PKI only) where {url}/api/register (POST) is used to register the client
      certificate.

      Every call to the eMASS REST API will require the use of the agreed upon public key
      certificate and API key. The API key must be provided in the request header for all
      endpoint calls (api-key). If the service receives an untrusted certificate or API key, a
      401 error response code will be returned along with an error message.
      
      <strong>Available Request Headers:</strong>

      | Key      | Example Value            | Description
      |----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------
      |`api-key` |api-key-provided-by-emass |This API key must be provided in the request header for all endpoint calls
      |`user-uid`|USER.UID.KEY              |This User unique identifier key must be provided in the request header for all PUT, POST, and DELETE endpoint calls.
      |          |                          |Note: For DoD users this is the DoD ID Number (EIDIPI) on their DoD CAC.

      Users are required to log-in to eMASS and grant permissions for a client to update data
      within eMASS on their behalf. This is only required for actionable requests (PUT, POST,
      DELETE). The Registration Endpoint and all GET requests can be accessed without
      completing this process with the correct permissions.

      <strong>Approve API Client for Actionable Requests</strong><br>
      Users are required to log-in to eMASS and grant permissions for a client to update data
      within eMASS on their behalf. This is only required for actionable requests (PUT, POST,
      DELETE). The Registration Endpoint and all GET requests can be accessed without
      completing this process with the correct permissions. Please note that leaving a field
      parameter blank (for PUT/POST requests) has the potential to clear information in the
      active eMASS records.

      To establish an account with eMASS and/or acquire an api-key/user-uid, contact one of the listed POC:

tags:
  - name: Test
    description: >
      The Test Connection endpoint is provided by eMASS to verify and troubleshoot
      the connection to the web service
  - name: Registration
    description: >
      The Registration endpoint is provided by eMASS to allow users to register their certificate
      and obtain an API key. This API key must be provided in the request header for all
      endpoint calls (api-key).
  - name: Systems
    description: "The System endpoint provides the ability to access system data"
  - name: SystemRoles
    description: "The System Roles endpoints provide the ability to access user data assigned to systems"
  - name: Controls
    description: "The Control endpoints provide the ability to retrieve or update Security Control information to a system for both the Implementation Plan and Risk Assessment."
  - name: TestResults
    description: >
      The Test Result endpoints provide the ability to add test results for a system's DoD
      Assessment Procedures (CCIs) which determines NIST SP 80-53 Revision 4 Security
      Control Compliance (Compliant, Non-Compliant, Not Applicable). The endpoints also
      provide the ability to retrieve test results.
  - name: POAM
    description: >
      These endpoints provide the ability to add Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) items to a system.
      The endpoint also provides the ability to view, update and/or remove existing POA&M items and associated milestones in a system.
  - name: Artifacts
    description: >
      The Artifact endpoints provide the ability to add new Artifacts
      (supporting documentation/evidence for Security Control Assessments and system
      Authorization activities) to a system.
  - name: ApprovalChain
    description: >
      The Approval Chain endpoints provide the ability to view Security Controls’ locations in
      the Control Approval Chain (CAC) in a system and submit them to the 2nd role of the CAC
      for independent verification and validation. These endpoints also provide the ability to
      view the location of a system's package in the Package Approval Chain (PAC) and submit
      a new package for assessment and authorization.

          <strong>Information</strong><br>
          The request body of a POST request through the Artifact Endpoint accepts a single binary file
          with file extension ".zip" only. This accepted .zip file should contain one or more files
          corresponding to existing artifacts or new artifacts that will be created upon successful receipt.
          Filename uniqueness throughout eMASS will be enforced by the API.<br><br>
          Upon successful receipt of a file, if a file within the .zip is matched via filename to an artifact
          existing within the application, the file associated with the artifact will be updated. If no artifact
          is matched via filename to the application, a new artifact will be created with the following
          default values. Any values not specified below will be blank.
          <ul>
            <li>isTemplate: false</li>
