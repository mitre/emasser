Remove one or many artifacts in a system

Provide single file or a space/comma delimited list of file names to be removed from the system (systemId)

Example:

bundle exec exe/emasser delete artifacts remove [-s, --systemId] <value> [-f, --files] <value> 
or
bundle exec exe/emasser delete artifacts remove [-s, --systemId] <value> [-f, --files] <value ... value>
