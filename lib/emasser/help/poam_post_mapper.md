  |Completed       |scheduledCompletionDate, comments, completionDate, milestones (at least 1)
  |Not Applicable  |POAM can not be created

If a POC email is supplied, the application will attempt to locate a user already registered within the application and pre-populate any information not explicitly supplied in the request. If no such user is found, these fields are required within the request.
  - pocFirstName, pocLastName, pocPhoneNumber

Business logic, the following rules apply when adding POA&Ms

- POA&M Items cannot be saved if associated Security Control or AP is inherited.
- POA&M Items cannot be created manually if a Security Control or AP is Not Applicable.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date is in the future.
- Completed POA&M Item cannot be saved if Completion Date (completionDate) is in the future.
- Risk Accepted POA&M Item cannot be saved with a Scheduled Completion Date or Milestones
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Not Approved" cannot be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item  Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Approved" can be saved if Milestone Scheduled Completion Date exceeds POA&M Item Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Completed" and a status of "Ongoing" cannot be saved without Milestones.
- POA&M Items that have a status of "Risk Accepted" cannot have milestones.
- POA&M Items with a review status of "Approved" that have a status of "Completed" and "Ongoing" cannot update Scheduled Completion Date.
- POA&M Items that have a review status of "Approved" are required to have a Severity Value assigned.
- POA&M Items cannot be updated if they are included in an active package.
- Archived POA&M Items cannot be updated.
- POA&M Items with a status of "Not Applicable" will be updated through test result creation.
- If the Security Control or Assessment Procedure does not exist in the system we may have to just import POA&M Item at the System Level.

Example:
If running from source code:
  bundle exec [ruby] exe/emasser post poams add --systemId [value] --status [value] --vulnerabilityDescription [value] --sourceIdentVuln [value] --pocOrganization [value] --resources [value]
If running from gem:
  emasser post poams add --systemId [value] --status [value] --vulnerabilityDescription [value] --sourceIdentVuln [value] --pocOrganization [value] --resources [value]

Notes:
1 - The format for milestones is:
    --milestone description:[value] scheduledCompletionDate:[value]
2 - Based on the value for the status (--status) parameter there are other required fields
3 - Refer to instructions listed above for conditional and optional fields requirements.
